# Passive-Learning-estimates-Rectangle-Casuality
Suppose we want to estimate the causal effect of the length of a rectangle's sides on its area. We can use passive learning to estimate this causal effect by generating some sample data of rectangle lengths and areas and then fitting a LinearRegression model to the data.
